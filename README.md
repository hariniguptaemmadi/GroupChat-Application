# Leaf Village Group Chat (Java Socket Programming + GUI)

A multi-client real-time group chat application built in Java, inspired by characters from the Naruto anime series. This desktop app uses **Java Socket Programming**, **AWT/Swing**, and **multithreading** to simulate seamless communication between multiple users, each themed as a unique ninja from the *Leaf Village*.

## Description

The screenshot shows a real-time multi-user chat application GUI built using Java Swing. It features:

A custom anime-themed chat window titled The Leaf Village.The top bar displays user avatars, chat name, and participants (Itachi, Naruto, Obito, Sasuke, Kakashi).Messages appear in bubble format, with timestamps.A custom background image (Leaf Village) sets a themed tone.
Three users are actively sending and receiving messages.This interface effectively demonstrates both networking and GUI skills in a creative, themed way.

## Features

- **Multithreaded Server**: Handles multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Messages are broadcasted instantly across all connected clients.
- **Custom GUI**: AWT/Swing-based UI with background image, rounded chat bubbles, and timestamps.
- **User Personalization**: Predefined characters like *Itachi, Naruto, Sasuke, Obito, Kakashi* simulate a team chat environment.
- **Themed Interface**: Narutoâ€™s Leaf Village as the background â€” improves visual engagement.

## Tech Stack

- **Java**  
- **Java AWT & Swing**  
- **TCP Socket Programming**  
- **Multithreading**  
- **Object-Oriented Design**

##  How It Works

1. **Server.java**  
   - Listens on a port (`2003`) and creates a new thread for every connected user.
   - Maintains a list of active writers to broadcast messages.

2. **User1.java, User2.java, ...**  
   - GUI client programs representing different characters.
   - Connects to the server and sends/receives chat messages.
   - Custom styling with image backgrounds and timestamps.

## Learning Outcomes

- Developed a strong understanding of **network protocols** and **concurrent programming** in Java.
- Built real-time synchronization between threads and UI updates.
- Gained experience in **custom GUI design**, error handling, and client-server architecture.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add **dynamic login/signup** with custom usernames.

- Include **file/image sharing** support.

- Implement basic encryption for message **privacy**.

- Chat **history** log.
