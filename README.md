# Leaf Village Group Chat (Java Socket Programming + GUI)

A multi-client real-time group chat application built in Java, inspired by characters from the Naruto anime series. This desktop app uses **Java Socket Programming**, **AWT/Swing**, and **multithreading** to simulate seamless communication between multiple users, each themed as a unique ninja from the *Leaf Village*.

##  How It Works

1. **Server.java**  
   - Listens on a port (`2003`) and creates a new thread for every connected user.
   - Maintains a list of active writers to broadcast messages.

2. **User1.java, User2.java, ...**  
   - GUI client programs representing different characters.
   - Connects to the server and sends/receives chat messages.
   - Custom styling with image backgrounds and timestamps.

## Learning Outcomes

- Developed a strong understanding of **network protocols** and **concurrent programming** in Java.
- Built real-time synchronization between threads and UI updates.
- Gained experience in **custom GUI design**, error handling, and client-server architecture.
